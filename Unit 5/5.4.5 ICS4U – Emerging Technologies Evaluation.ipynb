While driving, autonomous cars continuously store data about their surroundings that allows them to learn and get smarter. This raises many security issues as self-driving cars hold large amounts of data including where the driver and passenger have been, driver communication when mobile phones are hooked, and conversations in the vehicle between drivers and passengers. \n",
