SECTION A
Question 1 - How Self-Driving Cars Will Affect Society & the Environment
Positive Impacts:
Fewer Traffic Accidents – Self-driving cars can reduce crashes caused by human mistakes, making roads safer.
Less Traffic Congestion – Smart AI can optimize traffic flow, reducing delays.
Better Mobility for Elderly & Disabled People – Those who cannot drive will have more independence.
Negative Impacts:
Job Losses – Taxi drivers, truck drivers, and delivery workers may lose jobs.
Ethical Problems – If a crash is unavoidable, who should the car protect? This is a difficult question.
More Energy Use – If people use self-driving cars more than public transport, energy demand could rise.
Lower Emissions (Maybe) – If self-driving cars use electricity efficiently, they could reduce pollution.

Question 2 - Privacy & Data Collection
Would this be a concern for me?
Yes. Self-driving cars collect a lot of personal data, like location history and conversations. 
If this data is hacked or sold, it could be misused. I wouldn’t feel safe if companies or governments could track my movements.

Should courts allow car data in legal cases?
Yes, but with rules. Data should be used fairly to determine who is at fault.
If data helps solve legal disputes, it should be allowed, but private info should stay protected.
Criminal Cases – If the data is crucial for solving crimes (like a hit-and-run), it should be used, but strict laws should prevent misuse.







SECTION B
Question 1
1. How is computer vision used in self-driving cars?
Object Detection – Finds cars, people, traffic lights, and animals on the road.
Lane Detection – Tracks lane lines to keep the car centered and prevent drifting.
Traffic Sign Reading – Reads stop signs, speed limits, and other important road signs.
Obstacle Avoidance – Identifies sudden obstacles like fallen objects or crossing pedestrians and reacts quickly.

2. What is LiDAR and how does it help?
LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) uses lasers to scan the area and create a 3D map.
It measures distance between the car and objects with high accuracy.
It works well in low light or fog since it doesn’t rely on regular cameras.
Helps with precise navigation by detecting road curves, other vehicles, and small obstacles.

3. Does Tesla use LiDAR or Computer Vision? Why?
Tesla only uses cameras and AI (Computer Vision).
They say LiDAR is too expensive and unnecessary for full self-driving.
Tesla’s AI uses neural networks to process camera images, like human vision.
They believe learning from real-world driving data is the best way to improve.


Question 2
CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) – Recognizes objects, pedestrians, and road signs in camera images.
Reinforcement Learning – Learns from past driving experiences to make smarter decisions.
Decision Trees – Helps the car choose between options (stop, slow down, change lanes).
Sensor Fusion – Combines data from cameras, radar, LiDAR (if used), and GPS for better accuracy.
Path Planning Algorithms – Calculates the best route and avoids obstacles smoothly.


Question 3
Can Generative AI help self-driving cars?
Simulates different driving situations for better AI training.
Creates realistic virtual environments to test self-driving software safely.
Fills in missing data on maps, making navigation more precise.
Improves in-car voice assistants, making them smarter in conversations.






SECTION C
Subjects Needed
Self-driving car careers require computer science (AI, programming), math (calculus, statistics), 
physics (motion, sensors), engineering (mechanical, electrical, automotive), robotics (autonomous systems)

Skills Needed
Key skills include programming (Python, C++), AI & machine learning (neural networks, reinforcement learning),
math & data analysis (calculus, probability, optimization), path planning, control (safe navigation algorithms),
cybersecurity (protection from hacking), problem-solving, and teamwork , communication.

Education Level
A Bachelor’s degree in computer science, engineering, or AI is required.
A Master’s degree is recommended for advanced AI and robotics roles. 
A PhD is best for high-level research and innovation in self-driving technology.






SECTION D
If a self-driving car gets into an accident, I think the car owner should be responsible, but only if they agreed to the terms when buying the car. 
The person who designs the car sets the ethical rules in the software, and the owner accepts them when they buy and use the car. 
Since the owner chooses to use the self-driving system, they should take responsibility for accidents caused by the programmed decisions.

However, if the accident happens because the car does not follow its programmed rules, then the engineers or manufacturers could be responsible. 
If the software does something unexpected or goes against the agreed programming, the responsibility should shift to the people who designed it. 

This way, responsibility is clear—owners take the risk when they accept the terms, and designers are only blamed if the car fails to act as intended.
