    "Pygame is event-driven.  That means it is not a linear flowing program that you have been used to creating.  The program waits for events to happen, and then responds accordingly.  Common events might be mouse clicks, keyboard presses, collisions.  To make this happen you will require and infinite game loop that never stops until the program is closed.  Basically your loop will accomplish the following tasks\n",

    "\n",
    "I have decided to come up with a way to do all this so it follows the curriculum for the course.  We are taking an Object Oriented Approach to creating these games.  That is, you must think of everything in the game as an object.  Everything you add to your games will be coded inside classes.  (It doesn’t have to but we have an obligation to meet the curriculum requirements, so that is what you are going to do)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this easier, and to take the focus off of actually having to learn the gritty details of pygame, we are going to use a custom Module that I created. You MUST use this module when doing your assignments to ensure that you are meeting the curriculum requirements on the course."
