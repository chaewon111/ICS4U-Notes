    "## Instructions\n",
    "These ICS4U Grade 12 Computer Science python coding questions will form a part of your final grade for this course and are to be handed in for grading. \n",
    "\n",
    "For all of the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a Python IDE of your choice and create a coded solution to each of the given problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hand in commented .py files for your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your grade will be based on your ability to demonstrate the overall expectations from the Ontario Computer Studies Curriculum\n",

    "- A3 – Designing Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Read and write data to external data files\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use search and sort algorithms to solve a problem\n",

    "- A4 – Code Maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Write appropriate internal documentation explaining main points of the code\n",

    "    - Carry Out a testing plan for an algorithm\n",

    "- C2 – Analyze Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Investigate the efficiency of different searching and sorting algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important\n",
    "Since you will be using File Input and Output in these questions, store the name of your data file in a variable in the very first line at the top of your program.  Then use that variable in your code to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is so that I can easily change the file name with my own test data when grading.  I won’t have to go and change anything in your code other than the first line. "
